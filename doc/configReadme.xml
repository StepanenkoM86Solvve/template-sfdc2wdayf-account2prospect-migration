		<section id="use_case">
As an admin I want to migrate Accounts from Salesforce to Workday as Prospects.

This template serves as a foundation for the process of migrating accounts from Salesforce, being able to specify the filtering criteria and desired behavior when an account already exists in Workday as Prospect.

As implemented, this template leverages the Mule batch module.
The batch job is divided into *Process* and *On Complete* stages.

Firstly the template queries all the existing Accounts at Salesforce that match the filtering criteria (in this case being a Prospect Account).
In the *Process* stage, the template queries the Workday for already existing prospects based on the Salesforce IDs retrieved before the batch processing.
The accounts get inserted or updated in the Workday system based on the results of these queries.
Lastly, the information about the migration results is sent to pre-configured e-mail recipient and output to the console as well.

There are certain pre-requisites that must be considered to run this template. All of them deal with the preparations in both source and destination systems, that must be made for the template to run smoothly. **Failing to do so could lead to unexpected behavior of the template.**

In any of the ways you would like to run this Template this is an example of the output you'll see after browse toting the HTTP endpoint:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Batch Process initiated&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;b&gt;ID:&lt;/b&gt;6eea3cc6-7c96-11e3-9a65-55f9f3ae584e&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Records to be processed: &lt;/b&gt;3&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Started execution on: &lt;/b&gt;Fri Mar 19 10:08:16 CET 2015
&lt;/pre&gt;

Once your app is all set and started, supposing you choose as domain name `sfdcaccountmigration` to trigger the use case you just need to browse to `http://sfdcaccountmigration.cloudhub.io/migrateaccounts` and report will be sent to the emails configured.

		<section id="api_calls">
		
		Salesforce imposes limits on the number of API Calls that can be made. However, we make API call to Salesforce only once during migration, so this is not something to worry about.

		<section id="default_endpoints_xml">
		
This is the file where you will find the inbound side of your integration app.
This template has only a [HTTP Connector](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/HTTP+Connector) as the way to trigger the use case.

###  Inbound Flow
**HTTP Connector** - Start Report Generation

+ `${http.port}` is set as a property to be defined either on a property file or in CloudHub environment variables.
+ The path configured by default is `migrateaccounts` and you are free to change it for the one that you prefer.
+ The host name for all endpoints in your CloudHub configuration should be defined as `0.0.0.0`. CloudHub will then route requests from your application domain URL to the endpoint.

Functional aspect of the Template is implemented on this XML, directed by one flow responsible of excecuting the logic.
For the pourpose of this particular Template the *mainFlow* just excecutes a batch job which handles all the migration logic.
This flow has Exception handler that points to *errorHandling.xml* file.
